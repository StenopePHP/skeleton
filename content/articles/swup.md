[Swup](https://swup.js.org/) is a library that allows you to give a <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr>
feel to your static website.

This skeleton integrates it using [Symfony UX](https://ux.symfony.com/swup) and
configures [scroll](https://swup.js.org/plugins/scroll-plugin) and [progress](https://swup.js.org/plugins/progress-plugin) 
plugins to enhance the navigation experience.

!!! Note
    A custom style is provided by the skeleton theme in `assets/styles/skeleton-theme/components/swup.scss`.  
    If you'd like to keep Swup, think about creating your own before removing the skeleton theme.
